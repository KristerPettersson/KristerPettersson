- 👋 Hi, I’m @KristerPettersson
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a linux distro becoming as efficient for me as my Apple-machines and some Apple-special software has been for my in my job in international project management with a lot of outlining, planning, presentation, documentation etc work. The main reason for leaving Apple is the fact that my well functioning machines are not longer supported, too sluggish, to rigid etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the possibilities and differences of the various distros and software repositories available.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on translations - mainly to Swedish from English, Spanish or Portuguese
- 📫 How to reach me via e-mail hkristerp@gmail.com
